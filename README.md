# Dolev-Strong Algorithm

## Simulation with pseudo multi-threading

### KACZMARSKI Lucas and GOULAMHOUSSEN Sunil

## Installation

- Pull the code from github
- Install a virtual environment : `python -m venv venv`
- Activate the python3 virtual environment : (Linux & MacOS) `source venv/bin/activate` / (Windows) `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
- You don't need to install any dependencies, I only used built-in libraries

## Launch the project

- Run the following command in the terminal : `python ./main.py`

That's it! Thanks for reading me!
